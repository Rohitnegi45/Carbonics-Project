# Carbonics-Project
Overview
The Carbon Crunch website is a modern and interactive landing page that focuses on sustainability and carbon footprint management. This page incorporates engaging animations, a responsive layout, and dynamic elements, all designed to enhance the user experience and draw attention to the main objective of the platform: promoting sustainability reporting and environmental responsibility.

Approach
The website consists of several key sections:

1. Navigation Bar
The header features a logo and a navigation bar with links to various sections of the site (Home, Services, Blog, About Us, and Contact).
Buttons for Login and Book Demo are also included in the header for easy access.
2. Hero Section
The hero section includes a bold call-to-action message that promotes the sustainability platform.
The title text (h1) animates in a wavy manner, transitioning between light black and dark black colors.
The span inside the title (CARBON CRUNCH) changes from light green to its original color, indicating emphasis.
Buttons for "Free Calculator" and "Book Demo" appear below the title, providing clear actions for the user.
3. Statistics Section (Blocks)
A section with statistical data presented in cards. Each card has a different background color and contains key metrics, such as the percentage of companies with net-zero targets and the CEOs' opinions on sustainability.
Hover effects and animations make the cards interactive, enhancing user engagement.
4. Floating Animation
The page includes a floating squares animation in the background to add dynamic motion and interest to the page without overwhelming the content.
5. Interactive Card Animations
Each card in the statistics section has a subtle 3D hover effect that adds a parallax-like effect when hovered over.
A cascading animation is applied to the cards, making them appear sequentially when the page loads.
Technologies Used
1. HTML5
The structure of the website is built using semantic HTML5 tags to ensure accessibility and maintain a clean, logical structure.
2. CSS3
CSS Grid and Flexbox are used for layout management.
Advanced CSS animations are used to create dynamic text effects, including wavy color transitions and hover effects on buttons and cards.
CSS Keyframes are used for the floating squares background animation and other subtle animations.
3. JavaScript
JavaScript is used to:
Generate random square elements for the floating background animation.
Add interactivity to the cards with animations and effects on hover.
Control the dynamic load of the cards with a cascading animation effect.
Event listeners are added for hover and mouse move effects on the cards to create interactive 3D effects.
4. Responsive Design
The website layout is designed to be responsive using percentage-based widths and media queries to ensure that it works well on all screen sizes.
5. Assets
Images (such as the logo and icons) are included in the project to improve visual appeal.
The background image for the body of the website is set to a custom image (image\ copy.png), creating a sustainable and environmental feel.
Key Features
Responsive Layout: The website adjusts to various screen sizes, making it user-friendly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
